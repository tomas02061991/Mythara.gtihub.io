In the heart of Verdantia, where the lush greenery meets the bustling hub of civilization, lies the vibrant city of Keirthal, jewel of the realm and seat of power for the verdant kingdom.

<p>Keirthal is a city of contrasts, where ancient traditions blend seamlessly with modern innovation, and the past and present coexist in perfect harmony. Its streets are alive with the hustle and bustle of commerce, as merchants peddle their wares in bustling marketplaces and artisans ply their trade in workshops and studios.</p>

<p>At the heart of the city lies the majestic castle, a towering fortress of stone and wood that serves as the seat of power for the verdant monarchs. Here, amidst the grandeur of marble halls and gilded chambers, the rulers of Verdantia hold court, dispensing justice and guidance to their loyal subjects.</p>

<p>Surrounding the castle are the eight districts of Keirthal, each with its own unique character and charm.
