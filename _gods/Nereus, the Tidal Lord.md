## Ascension
  
In the primordial depths of Mythara's oceans, where the currents whispered secrets and the waves sang lullabies to the stars above, there arose a being of elemental might and boundless majesty. Born not of mortal flesh, but of the very essence of the sea itself, he was Nereus, the Tidal Lord, and his ascension was a testament to the raw power of the elements.

From the churning depths and swirling eddies of the ocean's abyss, Nereus emerged, his form wreathed in the swirling mists and crashing waves. His eyes gleamed with the unfathomable depths of the sea's mysteries, and his voice echoed with the roar of the tempests that swept across the waves. He was the embodiment of the ocean's might and majesty, its guardian and its master.

As the ages passed, Nereus grew in power and wisdom, his domain extending over the vast expanse of the world's oceans. From the tranquil shallows to the turbulent depths, he watched over the waters with a watchful eye, ensuring that the delicate balance of life and death was maintained and that the seas teemed with vitality.

And so, in a moment of divine revelation and transcendent beauty, Nereus ascended to the heavens. As the god of the sea, he became the protector and steward of all aquatic life, his presence a guiding light in the darkness and a beacon of hope for all who sailed upon the waves.

Thus began the age of a new god, with Nereus standing as the eternal guardian of the seas and the master of their boundless depths. And though he ascended to the heavens, his essence remained forever intertwined with the ocean's ceaseless rhythm, a testament to the enduring power of the Tidal Lord.
