![Sylvarin](../images/narwhalofwar_A_city_district_of_towering_trees_and_verdant_un_477efa3d-075b-4b26-a67f-87e0d79a57a4_3.png)A realm of towering trees and verdant undergrowth, Sylvarin is nestled in the heart of an ancient forest. Sunlight filters through the leafy canopy, casting a dappled pattern on the forest floor as birds flit through branches overhead. It's a place of magic and mystery, where hidden glades and secret clearings await discovery.
